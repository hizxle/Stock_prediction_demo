# Prediction Sber stock prices demo
==============================

A time series prediction model that validates Sber MOEX price data and predicts price movements over a 1-hour period. In addition to numerical data, it analyzes financial news from external sources (NLP).

The code is implemented as a part of the bootcamp [codaim]([url](https://xn--d1aiafni.xn--l1afu.xn--p1ai/bootcamp)) organized by CPM and MIPT (Deep Learning School). The dataset was taken from a case provided by Sber for the [AI Challenge]([url](https://aiijc.com/en/)) contest.
